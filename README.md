# Pavel Khudobin

I'm currently a 1C developer transitioning into machine learning. I'm passionate about learning new things and applying my technical skills to solve real-world problems. I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects.

## Skills

*   Python
*   SQL, Document-based databases
*   Machine Learning libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, CatBoost, 
*   Data Science Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas
*   Data Visualization: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   Hadoop

## Projects

*   **HealthRiskPredictiveModel:** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ShadaR3/HealthRiskPredictiveModel))
    > Developed a comprehensive health risk assessment model predicting chronic disease likelihood using Canadian health survey data. Employed extensive EDA, feature engineering, and rigorous evaluation of various ML models (including XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks, Sklearn, CatBoost), using AUC as the key metric to identify the optimal solution for accurate risk prediction and actionable insights. Leveraged statistical analysis and model explainability techniques (SHAP/LIME) to ensure robustness and interpretability.
*   **Telegram Bot:** ([@My_Relocation_bot](https://t.me/My_Relocation_bot)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ShadaR3/tg_bot))
    > This project collects information from various sources, cleans it, and allows users to access it through the Telegram chat.
*   **Coursera Capstone Project:** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ShadaR3/Coursera_Capstone))
    > This is my capstone project from the IBM Data Science Specialization on Coursera.
